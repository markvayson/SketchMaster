# Sketch Master

This project is a sketch pad that allows you to create pixel art by hovering over a grid of square divs. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. Open the [game] file in your web browser.
2. A 16x16 grid of square divs will be displayed on the screen.
3. Hover your mouse over the squares to change their color.
4. To reset the grid and create a new sketch pad, click the "New Grid" button at the top of the screen. You will be prompted to enter the number of squares per side for the new grid. The maximum limit is 100.
5. The existing grid will be removed, and a new grid with the specified number of squares per side will be generated.
6. Enjoy creating pixel art with Sketch Master!

## Extra Credit

This project includes additional features for a more interactive experience:

- Each interaction with a square randomizes its RGB value, resulting in a different color each time.
- The squares also darken progressively with each interaction, adding 10% more black or color. The objective is to achieve a completely black square after ten interactions.

Feel free to customize and enhance the project further based on your creativity and ideas!
