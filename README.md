# Sketch Master

This project is a sketch pad that allows you to create pixel art by hovering over a grid of square divs. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. Open the [game](https://markvayson.github.io/SketchMaster/).
2. A 16x16 grid of square divs will be displayed on the screen.
3. Click or drag over the squares to change their color.
4. At the top-right of the screen, there is a menu where you can:
    + Change the Grid size, by using the slider or by entering the amount. Max size limit is 64.
    + Change the  Color you want for the grid when clicked.
    + Change between 3 Modes: Color (Pick a color) , Rainbow (Random color) , Eraser (White color).
    + Clear the Grid.
5. Enjoy creating pixel art with Sketch Master!

## Extra

This project includes additional features for a more interactive experience:

- Each interaction with a square randomizes its RGB value, resulting in a different color each time.
- (Coming Soon) The squares also darken progressively with each interaction, adding 10% more black or color. The objective is to achieve a completely black square after ten interactions.
